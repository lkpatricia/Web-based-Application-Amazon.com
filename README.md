 Ki Magic is a web-based application for Amazon.com merchants. Utilizing Amazon.com MWS  (Marketplace Web Service) API it monitors the competition and adjusts retail prices according to  user-defined targets. For Ki Magic I am responsible for designing the layout and all graphical assets  (including logo and custom icons), designing and building the user interface with HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, jQuery, and jQWidgets, and CRUD manipulation of MySQL datatables with PHP, Ajax, and  JSON. The application is built on a CakePHP framework which uses a MVC file structure. The UI  includes elements such as grids, tabs, popups, sliders, input fields, drop down lists, and switch  buttons.
